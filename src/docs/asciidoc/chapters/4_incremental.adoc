== Up to date and incremental tasks

=== Why does it matter?

* Gradle is meant for incremental builds
* `clean` is a waste of time
* Time is $$$

=== The incrementality test

[%step]
* Run a build
* Run again with no change
* If a task was re-executed, you got it wrong

=== Incremental build

A task is UP-TO-DATE iff:

* Inputs have not changed
* Outputs are still present and un-tampered

=== Change detection

* Hash of input / output files
* Hash of contents of input / output folders
* Serialize input properties

=== Control change detection

* `--rerun-tasks` bypasses up-to-date checks
* Running at _info_ level will give you insights in up-to-date calculations

=== Example: building a shaded jar

[source,groovy]
----
task shadedJar(type: ShadedJar) {
   jarFile.set(file("$buildDir/libs/shaded.jar"))
   classpath.from(configurations.runtimeClasspath)
   mapping.put('org.apache', 'shaded.org.apache')
}
----

* What are the task inputs?
* What are the task outputs?
* What if one of them changes?

=== Declaring inputs

[source,java]
----
public abstract class ShadedJar extends DefaultTask {
   ...
   @InputFiles
   abstract ConfigurableFileCollection getClasspath();

   @Input
   abstract MapProperty<String, String> getMapping();
}
----

=== Declaring outputs

[source,java]
----
public abstract class ShadedJar extends DefaultTask {
   ...

   @OutputFile
   abstract RegularFileProperty getJarFile();
}
----

=== Annotation sensitivity

- `@InputFiles`: File path or contents
- `@Classpath`: File contents only, order sensitive
- `@CompileClasspath`: **Class** file contents, limited to ABI
- `@Input`: Value change

=== Incremental task inputs

* Know precisely _which_ files have changed
* Task action can perform the minimal amount of work
* No time for this today!
