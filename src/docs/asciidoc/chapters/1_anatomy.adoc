=== Summary

Gradle is based on a set of conventions.

Some inherited from the history of Java build systems:

* `src/main/java`
* `src/test/resources`

Others brought by Gradle:

* The name of the project is the name of the containing folder

=== The build file

* By default, named `build.gradle` which can be configured.
* Describes what the build is about through configuration.

=== Companion files

* `settings.gradle`: Configure the project(s) that compose the build
* `gradle.properties`: Defines properties specific to the build, which can be overridden

=== Additional build artifacts

Directories:

* `buildSrc`
* `.gradle`
* `build`

=== The Gradle Wrapper

[%step]
* Bootstraps Gradle for project contributors
* Project controls Gradle version
