== Concepts

=== Gradle lifecycle

Configuration phase

* Discovering projects
* Build scripts evaluation
* Model construction
* Task graph construction

=== Gradle lifecycle (2)

Execution phase

* Run tasks that are required by the build invocation

=== Demo 3.1

Demo

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Create a simple build.gradle
* Add two inline tasks that doing a println
* Execute one task
** Both println appear
* Move println to doLast
* Execute one task
** Single println appear
--

=== Lifecycle best practices

* Do the minimum during configuration
** At this stage, Gradle walks all configuration items to determine which need to be part of the execution

=== Concepts by example

What are the building blocks of a _compile_ task for a Java project?

=== Tasks

It is the target of a build execution and does the work.

=== Task actions

[source, groovy]
----
include::{buildsdir}/hello.gradle[]
----

* `doLast` adding actions to a task

=== Task type

[source, groovy]
----
include::{buildsdir}/compile.gradle[]
----

* Provides declarative configuration
* Task action is defined by the task type
* Models what the build is about in terms of execution

=== What does _compile_ do then?

Transform Java source files into class files.

=== Task inputs

* Java source files
* Source encoding
* Compile options
* Classpath

=== Task outputs

* Class files

=== Importance of inputs / outputs

You can think of a Gradle task as a function.

Based on a set of inputs, you produce outputs.

And ideally, the same set of inputs results in the same outputs.

=== Inputs origin

* Java source files
** `SourceSet` concept
* Source encoding & compile options
** Task configuration
* Classpath
** From associated configuration

=== Configurations

A configuration is a container of dependencies and produced artifacts.

A configuration can extend another one, inheriting its dependencies.

=== Dependencies

A dependency is a pointer to another piece of software required to build, test or run your project.

When declaring a dependency, you tie it to a `Configuration`.

=== In practice

[source, groovy]
----
include::{buildsdir}/javaDependencies.gradle[]
----

=== Constructing the classpath

* Resolve the configuration
** Resolve the graph of dependencies
** Retrieve or build the dependencies
* Build the classpath

=== Invocation chain

* User requests `compileJava`
* -> Build needs the compileClasspath
* -> Build needs to resolve the `implementation` configuration

=== Building the task graph

Gradle will arrange tasks in an execution graph during the configuration phase:

* Each task to be executed is a node
* Implicit and explicit relationships define the edges between nodes
* No cycles are allowed
